There’s no need to input difficult mathematical equations. Under the hood, OptaPlanner combines sophisticated optimization heuristics and metaheuristics (such as Tabu Search, Simulated Annealing and Late Acceptance) with very efficient score calculation.\nOptaPlanner is open source software, released under the Apache Software License.

   "Don't make the same mistakes we did! Take the shortcut, by letting us help you avoid the same traps. We have plenty of experience in software development and we like to share it. It's not only knowing your way around technology. It's also about how you think about it and how you do it. Whether as an individual or a small team coaching is probably the most effective way to acquire new skills and to learn and adopt a mindset that helps building better software."},

     "OptaPlanner is a constraint satisfaction solver. It optimizes business resource planning use cases, such as Vehicle Routing, Employee Rostering, Cloud Optimization, Job Scheduling, Bin Packing and many more. Every organization faces such scheduling puzzles: assign a limited set of constrained resources (employees, assets, time and money) to provide products or services to customers. OptaPlanner optimizes those planning problems to do more business with less resources.\nOptaPlanner is a lightweight, embeddable planning engine. It enables normal Java™ programmers to solve optimization problems efficiently. Constraints apply on plain domain objects and can reuse existing code. There’s no need to input difficult mathematical equations. Under the hood, OptaPlanner combines sophisticated optimization heuristics and metaheuristics (such as Tabu Search, Simulated Annealing and Late Acceptance) with very efficient score calculation.\nOptaPlanner is open source software, released under the Apache Software License. It is written in 100% pure Java™, runs on any JVM and is available in the Maven Central repository too."},
