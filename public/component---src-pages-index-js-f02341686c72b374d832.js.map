Most commonly\n\t * it's used to animate the mounting and unmounting of a component, but can also\n\t * be used to describe in-place transition states as well.\n\t *\n\t * ---\n\t *\n\t * **Note**: `Transition` is a platform-agnostic base component. If you're using\n\t * transitions in CSS, you'll probably want to use\n\t * [`CSSTransition`](https://reactcommunity.org/react-transition-group/css-transition)\n\t * instead. It inherits all the features of `Transition`, but contains\n\t * additional features necessary to play nice with CSS transitions (hence the\n\t * name of the component).\n\t *\n\t * ---\n\t *\n\t * By default the `Transition` component does not alter the behavior of the\n\t * component it renders, it only tracks \"enter\" and \"exit\" states for the\n\t * components. It's up to you to give meaning and effect to those states. For\n\t * example we can add styles to a component when it enters or exits:\n\t *\n\t * ```jsx\n\t * import { Transition } from 'react-transition-group';\n\t *\n\t * const duration = 300;\n\t *\n\t * const defaultStyle = {\n\t *   transition: `opacity ${duration}ms ease-in-out`,\n\t *   opacity: 0,\n\t * }\n\t *\n\t * const transitionStyles = {\n\t *   entering: { opacity: 0 },\n\t *   entered:  { opacity: 1 },\n\t * };\n\t *\n\t * const Fade = ({ in: inProp }) => (\n\t *   <Transition in={inProp} timeout={duration}>\n\t *     {state => (\n\t *       <div style={{\n\t *         ...defaultStyle,\n\t *         ...transitionStyles[state]\n\t *       }}>\n\t *         I'm a fade Transition!\n\t *       </div>\n\t *     )}\n\t *   </Transition>\n\t * );\n\t * ```\n\t *\n\t * There are 4 main states a Transition can be in:\n\t *  - `'entering'`\n\t *  - `'entered'`\n\t *  - `'exiting'`\n\t *  - `'exited'`\n\t *\n\t * Transition state is toggled via the `in` prop. When `true` the component\n\t * begins the \"Enter\" stage. During this stage, the component will shift from\n\t * its current transition state, to `'entering'` for the duration of the\n\t * transition and then to the `'entered'` stage once it's complete.

Most commonly\n\t   * it's used to animate the mounting and unmounting of a component, but can also\n\t   * be used to describe in-place transition states as well.\n\t   *\n\t   * By default the `Transition` component does not alter the behavior of the\n\t   * component it renders, it only tracks \"enter\" and \"exit\" states for the components.\n\t   * It's up to you to give meaning and effect to those states. For example we can\n\t   * add styles to a component when it enters or exits:\n\t   *\n\t   * ```jsx\n\t   * import Transition from 'react-transition-group/Transition';\n\t   *\n\t   * const duration = 300;\n\t   *\n\t   * const defaultStyle = {\n\t   *   transition: `opacity ${duration}ms ease-in-out`,\n\t   *   opacity: 0,\n\t   * }\n\t   *\n\t   * const transitionStyles = {\n\t   *   entering: { opacity: 0 },\n\t   *   entered:  { opacity: 1 },\n\t   * };\n\t   *\n\t   * const Fade = ({ in: inProp }) => (\n\t   *   <Transition in={inProp} timeout={duration}>\n\t   *     {(state) => (\n\t   *       <div style={{\n\t   *         ...defaultStyle,\n\t   *         ...transitionStyles[state]\n\t   *       }}>\n\t   *         I'm a fade Transition!\n\t   *       </div>\n\t   *     )}\n\t   *   </Transition>\n\t   * );\n\t   * ```\n\t   *\n\t   * As noted the `Transition` component doesn't _do_ anything by itself to its child component.\n\t   * What it does do is track transition states over time so you can update the\n\t   * component (such as by adding styles or classes) when it changes states.\n\t   *\n\t   * There are 4 main states a Transition can be in:\n\t   *  - `'entering'`\n\t   *  - `'entered'`\n\t   *  - `'exiting'`\n\t   *  - `'exited'`\n\t   *\n\t   * Transition state is toggled via the `in` prop. When `true` the component begins the\n\t   * \"Enter\" stage. During this stage, the component will shift from its current transition state,\n\t   * to `'entering'` for the duration of the transition and then to the `'entered'` stage once\n\t   * it's complete. Let's take the following example:\n\t   *\n\t   * ```jsx\n\t   * state = { in: false };\n\t   *\n\t   * toggleEnterState = () => {\n\t   *   this.setState({ in: true });\n\t   * }\n\t   *\n\t   * render() {\n\t   *   return (\n\t   *     <div>\n\t   *       <Transition in={this.state.in} timeout={500} />\n\t   *       <button onClick={this.toggleEnterState}>Click to Enter</button>\n\t   *     </div>\n\t   *   );\n\t   * }\n\t   * ```\n\t   *\n\t   * When the button is clicked the component will shift to the `'entering'` state and\n\t   * stay there for 500ms (the value of `timeout`) before it finally switches to `'entered'`.\n\t   *\n\t   * When `in` is `false` the same thing happens except the state moves from `'exiting'` to `'exited'`.\n\t   *\n\t   * ## Timing\n\t   *\n\t   * Timing is often the trickiest part of animation, mistakes can result in slight delays\n\t   * that are hard to pin down. A common example is when you want to add an exit transition,\n\t   * you should set the desired final styles when the state is `'exiting'`. That's when the\n\t   * transition to those styles will start and, if you matched the `timeout` prop with the\n\t   * CSS Transition duration, it will end exactly when the state changes to `'exited'`.\n\t   *\n\t   * > **Note**: For simpler transitions the `Transition` component might be enough, but\n\t   * > take into account that it's platform-agnostic, while the `CSSTransition` component\n\t   * > [forces reflows](https://github.com/reactjs/react-transition-group/blob/5007303e729a74be66a21c3e2205e4916821524b/src/CSSTransition.js#L208-L215)\n\t   * > in order to make more complex transitions more predictable.

Most commonly\n * it's used to animate the mounting and unmounting of a component, but can also\n * be used to describe in-place transition states as well.\n *\n * ---\n *\n * **Note**: `Transition` is a platform-agnostic base component. If you're using\n * transitions in CSS, you'll probably want to use\n * [`CSSTransition`](https://reactcommunity.org/react-transition-group/css-transition)\n * instead. It inherits all the features of `Transition`, but contains\n * additional features necessary to play nice with CSS transitions (hence the\n * name of the component).\n *\n * ---\n *\n * By default the `Transition` component does not alter the behavior of the\n * component it renders, it only tracks \"enter\" and \"exit\" states for the\n * components. It's up to you to give meaning and effect to those states. For\n * example we can add styles to a component when it enters or exits:\n *\n * ```jsx\n * import { Transition } from 'react-transition-group';\n *\n * const duration = 300;\n *\n * const defaultStyle = {\n *   transition: `opacity ${duration}ms ease-in-out`,\n *   opacity: 0,\n * }\n *\n * const transitionStyles = {\n *   entering: { opacity: 0 },\n *   entered:  { opacity: 1 },\n * };\n *\n * const Fade = ({ in: inProp }) => (\n *   <Transition in={inProp} timeout={duration}>\n *     {state => (\n *       <div style={{\n *         ...defaultStyle,\n *         ...transitionStyles[state]\n *       }}>\n *         I'm a fade Transition!\n *       </div>\n *     )}\n *   </Transition>\n * );\n * ```\n *\n * There are 4 main states a Transition can be in:\n *  - `'entering'`\n *  - `'entered'`\n *  - `'exiting'`\n *  - `'exited'`\n *\n * Transition state is toggled via the `in` prop. When `true` the component\n * begins the \"Enter\" stage. During this stage, the component will shift from\n * its current transition state, to `'entering'` for the duration of the\n * transition and then to the `'entered'` stage once it's complete. Let's take\n * the following example (we'll use the\n * [useState](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usestate) hook):\n *\n * ```jsx\n * function App() {\n *   const [inProp, setInProp] = useState(false);\n *   return (\n *     <div>\n *       <Transition in={inProp} timeout={500}>\n *         {state => (\n *           // ...\n *         )}\n *       </Transition>\n *       <button onClick={() => setInProp(true)}>\n *         Click to Enter\n *       </button>\n *     </div>\n *   );\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * When the button is clicked the component will shift to the `'entering'` state\n * and stay there for 500ms (the value of `timeout`) before it finally switches\n * to `'entered'`.\n *\n * When `in` is `false` the same thing happens except the state moves from\n * `'exiting'` to `'exited'`.\n */\n\nexports.EXITING = EXITING;\n\nvar Transition =\n/*#__PURE__*/\nfunction (_React$Component) {\n  _inheritsLoose(Transition, _React$Component);\n\n  function Transition(props, context) {\n    var _this;\n\n    _this = _React$Component.call(this, props, context) || this;\n    var parentGroup = context.transitionGroup; // In the context of a TransitionGroup all enters are really appears\n\n    var appear = parentGroup && !parentGroup.isMounting ?

Most commonly\n   * it's used to animate the mounting and unmounting of a component, but can also\n   * be used to describe in-place transition states as well.\n   *\n   * By default the `Transition` component does not alter the behavior of the\n   * component it renders, it only tracks \"enter\" and \"exit\" states for the components.\n   * It's up to you to give meaning and effect to those states. For example we can\n   * add styles to a component when it enters or exits:\n   *\n   * ```jsx\n   * import Transition from 'react-transition-group/Transition';\n   *\n   * const duration = 300;\n   *\n   * const defaultStyle = {\n   *   transition: `opacity ${duration}ms ease-in-out`,\n   *   opacity: 0,\n   * }\n   *\n   * const transitionStyles = {\n   *   entering: { opacity: 0 },\n   *   entered:  { opacity: 1 },\n   * };\n   *\n   * const Fade = ({ in: inProp }) => (\n   *   <Transition in={inProp} timeout={duration}>\n   *     {(state) => (\n   *       <div style={{\n   *         ...defaultStyle,\n   *         ...transitionStyles[state]\n   *       }}>\n   *         I'm a fade Transition!\n   *       </div>\n   *     )}\n   *   </Transition>\n   * );\n   * ```\n   *\n   * As noted the `Transition` component doesn't _do_ anything by itself to its child component.\n   * What it does do is track transition states over time so you can update the\n   * component (such as by adding styles or classes) when it changes states.\n   *\n   * There are 4 main states a Transition can be in:\n   *  - `'entering'`\n   *  - `'entered'`\n   *  - `'exiting'`\n   *  - `'exited'`\n   *\n   * Transition state is toggled via the `in` prop. When `true` the component begins the\n   * \"Enter\" stage. During this stage, the component will shift from its current transition state,\n   * to `'entering'` for the duration of the transition and then to the `'entered'` stage once\n   * it's complete. Let's take the following example:\n   *\n   * ```jsx\n   * state = { in: false };\n   *\n   * toggleEnterState = () => {\n   *   this.setState({ in: true });\n   * }\n   *\n   * render() {\n   *   return (\n   *     <div>\n   *       <Transition in={this.state.in} timeout={500} />\n   *       <button onClick={this.toggleEnterState}>Click to Enter</button>\n   *     </div>\n   *   );\n   * }\n   * ```\n   *\n   * When the button is clicked the component will shift to the `'entering'` state and\n   * stay there for 500ms (the value of `timeout`) before it finally switches to `'entered'`.\n   *\n   * When `in` is `false` the same thing happens except the state moves from `'exiting'` to `'exited'`.\n   *\n   * ## Timing\n   *\n   * Timing is often the trickiest part of animation, mistakes can result in slight delays\n   * that are hard to pin down. A common example is when you want to add an exit transition,\n   * you should set the desired final styles when the state is `'exiting'`. That's when the\n   * transition to those styles will start and, if you matched the `timeout` prop with the\n   * CSS Transition duration, it will end exactly when the state changes to `'exited'`.\n   *\n   * > **Note**: For simpler transitions the `Transition` component might be enough, but\n   * > take into account that it's platform-agnostic, while the `CSSTransition` component\n   * > [forces reflows](https://github.com/reactjs/react-transition-group/blob/5007303e729a74be66a21c3e2205e4916821524b/src/CSSTransition.js#L208-L215)\n   * > in order to make more complex transitions more predictable. For example, even though\n   * > classes `example-enter` and `example-enter-active` are applied immediately one after\n   * > another, you can still transition from one to the other because of the forced reflow\n   * > (read [this issue](https://github.com/reactjs/react-transition-group/issues/159#issuecomment-322761171)\n   * > for more info).
