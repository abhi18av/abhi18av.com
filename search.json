    "section": "",
    "text": "Large language models (LLMs) like GPT have captured the public’s attention, raising both overinflated expectations of generalized artificial intelligence (AGI) and fears of a takeover of the machines. Yet, in the right hands, LLMs can be powerful tools for improving public health surveillance, detecting early signals of pathogenic outbreaks from noisy social media, and supporting data-driven decision-making at a hitherto unprecedented scale. This presentation will briefly introduce what LLMs are (and, more importantly, what they aren’t), followed by a discussion of possible applications in public health as well as their risks, concluding with an equity-centered perspective on creating safe and unbiased AI/ML tools. Public health experts will undoubtedly find themselves as consumers of, and sometimes interactors with, such models, making it all the more crucial to build a fact-based understanding of this new tool and discuss how its risks are best mitigated.\nOrganised by the National Board of Public Health Examiners as part of their Webinar Wednesdays and open to the public, you can register here for the webinar on 10 January 2024 at 3pm ET."

I have more respect for those that live belly-down on the ground.”\n— Manoel de Barros\n\n\n\nPutting aside my reluctance to introduce myself publicly, I’m starting this journey for basically three reasons:\n1. First, because it might help you at some point in your professional journey, whether through my mistakes or my achievements;\n2. Second, because you might want to join one of the study groups I run on weekends, either in Portuguese or English (more details here);\n3. Finally, because we might create or join a new and exciting initiative for society. How great would that be?\nWell, let’s move on to the proper introductions, professionally speaking. After all, we are not defined by our degrees — they are just an important part of life, but not the most important one…\nMy name is Emilyn Costa Conceição Sharma, and I’m from Belém, Pará, Brazil. Despite the challenges my family and educators faced in getting me interested in studying during childhood, their persistence worked — and here I am.\nAfter a not-so-traditional journey, I fell in love with knowledge, and it became like magic chocolate: the more I consumed, the more there was to enjoy.\nAt that time, I had no internet, cellphone, or even TV access. My entire knowledge source came from formal education (school) and informal education (my grandmother’s library — she was a teacher). I went through many schools, experienced bullying, traumas, new beginnings, and later, found places that became emotional, intellectual, social, and protective oases.\nThis background made me want to be everything at once.\nTeenage years brought intense passions: for history, I wanted to be a historian; for music, a musician; for physics, I dreamed of NASA; for religion, I considered becoming a theologian or religious scholar; for sociology, geography, literature, and… biology. Eventually, I had to choose just two paths.\nMy choices were led by the desire to serve God and His creation through what challenged and fascinated me.\nFirst, I chose Medicine — because I love people and wanted to care for them.\nSecond, I chose Biology Education — a unique union between Science and Teaching.\nI love life, the diversity of life, and the paradoxical harmony between its simplicity and complexity.\nAnd what came of these choices? Here’s a summary of my short professional biography, copied and pasted from a recent conference where I was a speaker:\n\n\n“Emilyn holds a Biology degree from the Federal University of Pará (UFPA), with internships through CIEE and later through a scientific research project (PIBIC/CNPq) at the Molecular Biology Laboratory of the Bacteriology and Mycology Section at the Evandro Chagas Institute (SABMI/IEC), with which she maintains collaboration to this day. She earned a Master’s degree in Infectious Diseases from the State University of Pará (UEPA) and a PhD in Microbiology from the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ), with a ‘sandwich’ research period at Paris-Sud University, France, in collaboration with the Laboratory of Molecular Biology Applied to Mycobacteria (LABMAM) at the Oswaldo Cruz Institute – Fiocruz (IOC/Fiocruz).\nShe worked as a research technologist at Fiotec, in the Bacteriology and Bioassays Laboratory of the National Institute of Infectious Diseases (INI/Fiocruz), a regional reference in mycobacteria, where she gained experience in clinical research and molecular biology diagnostics for mycobacteria.

    "text": "My comment on the use of disinfectants as a treatment for COVID-19 was published in the Frankfurter Rundschau – along with some skepticism about sunlight as the best disinfectant:\n\nBeim Sonnenlicht als Corona-Faktor beruft sich das Weiße Haus auf eine Studie, die im “National Biodefense Analysis and Countermeasures Center” im Bundesstaat Maryland gemacht worden sein soll. Demnach schrumpft das Virus auf einer Edelstahloberfläche im Sonnenlicht bei einer Temperatur von 21 bis 24 Grad Celsius und 80 Prozent Luftfeuchtigkeit innerhalb von nur zwei Minuten auf die Hälfte seiner Größe - verglichen mit sechs Stunden im Dunkeln.\nDie Tatsache, dass es jedoch keine weiteren Details darüber gibt, wie das Experiment ausgeführt wurde, sorgt für Kopfschütteln bei Wissenschaftlern. “Es sieht so aus, als hätte jemand irgendwo ein Experiment durchgeführt”, sagte Benjamin Neuman, Vorsitzender der Biowissenschaften an der Texas A&M University-Texarkana, der Nachrichtenagentur AFP. “Als Wissenschaftler würde ich natürlich gerne eine aktuelle Studie und die tatsächlichen Zahlen sehen”, sagte der Virusepidemiologe Chris von Csefalvay. Mediziner reagierten fassungslos auf die Äußerungen des Präsidenten und warnten eindringlich davor, sich Desinfektionsmittel zu spritzen oder zu schlucken. Dies könne tödliche Folgen haben.\n\nRead the whole thing here.\nAnd on that note, the Manila Times also quoted me on the same topic.\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{von_csefalvay2020,\n  author = {von Csefalvay, Chris},\n  title = {Corona in Den {USA:} {Mediziner} Warnen Nun Vor {Injektion}\n    von {Desinfektionsmittel}},\n  date = {2020-05-11},\n  url = {https://chrisvoncsefalvay.com/media/fr-disinfectants},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nCsefalvay, Chris von. 2020. “Corona in Den USA: Mediziner Warnen\nNun Vor Injektion von Desinfektionsmittel.” May 11, 2020. https://chrisvoncsefalvay.com/media/fr-disinfectants."
