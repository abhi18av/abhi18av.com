ML flavors have a strong inclination towards Automated Theorem Proving, there are these four in particular which I'd love to understand more and explore

1. HOL-light
2. Coq
3. Lean
4. Z3


These do have bindings to languages like Haskell and Python but I'd really like to keep a major focus on OCaml ( ReasonML ) as an active major language.
