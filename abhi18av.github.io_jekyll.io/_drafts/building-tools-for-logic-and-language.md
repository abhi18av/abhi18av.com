I explored

- Racket
- Clojure

- Scala
- F#
- OCaml

- Haskell
- Frege

- C#
- Java

- D
- Go
- Rust

- Lua
- Python
- Julia
- Ruby
- Perl

And what I've learned that even though there are a few trade-offs involved with platforms like JVM and dotNET, like wise with languages like Julia, Perl etc. I need to weigh my options in terms of how well I can create a coherent set of integrated and *practical* tools which help me understand and explore languages in the most lucid and fluid way. 

Working on creating a couple projects - funneled down after a lot of random walks. And the major focus is of course laying the foundations for a way to ask questions from a language in a meaningful way.

Learning Chinese and Dutch using every possible thing I can think of - I'll start posting things in Chinese and Dutch soon enough. I must become good as fast as I can, the scholarship is my best shot forward.
