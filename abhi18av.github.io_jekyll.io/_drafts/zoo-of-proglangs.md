## Rust 

It's pretty awesome and as a sidenote, anything that says , metaprogramming has my undivided attention - llvm

## C++ 
( good gracious, this is the game programming language - sadly, it's used almost everywhere ")... some years down the line...not now

## C 

the granddaddy of all-big-things in a small package....this is the language one needs to gain experience in.

## Clojure 

often, I become utterly bored of programming - the world becomes too logical, then clojure is the only language that keeps me going, this is my mother tongue :)

## Java

Man!, this is a beast - it's absolutely everywhere. ...not displaced ...but running hte show - hopefullly oracle will have a renaissance soon


## Ruby

The best part about Ruby is that you get the world's most beginner friendly web-framework for free i.e. **Ruby on Rails** which is insanely awesome! Plus the language inherited all the good parts from Perl which also makes it really useful for one-liners and sys-admin tasks.

## Haskell 

## Frege 

My favorite brand of haskell and mathematical approach to programming - i'll definitely contribute to it


## Javascript 

This is the languages everyone knows and to get any sort of hacky-scalable solution for a web and incereasibngly other place - this is insanely working! ( i us clojurescript , so i don't even want to spend time on a rant :P )

## Julia 

The most promising language 

## Perl 

The world's most enviously small script builder - what a glue , sadly it's way too outside of my time-avaliaibility , only the 130 one -lineers


## Python ( Anaconda ) 

This is my goto solution for absolutely everything now! you name it, any prototoype, idea, data, visualization, desktop, game, algorithm etc - cOOl

## Mathematica 

Programmed in this in uni...beautifully designed, but not open source - I much prefer the sage( python ) solution to problems - I always hated the word MATLAB, would think about doing it even in my nightmares. Thankfully, Anaconda and Julia will make this monster obselete soon enough.

## Bash 

I want to avoid bash all the time, it's python that does the trick for me, hopefully xonch will boom out soon or it's just the pyipython repl which is my type :)


## OCaml 

Another beauty of programing world

## F# 

is my preffered flavor  for .net and *the* only language I can use Tail Call Recursion with! they say c# is good but its clojrueCLR and f# through and through for me on the .net platform!

I tried out D as well, but even though the design and the vision is quite aesthetic it can't possibly compete with the kind os enthusiasm Rust generates, nor is it as widespread as C++. The community and popularity is *the* best feature of a languag after personal preference - which is the reason I can't invest time in D ( and many other languages ) since I lack the experience and exposure to solving the kind of problems which might come up this way. 


There are of course a few more *really interesting* programming lanuages like
- F*
- Idris
- Racket

I'll write more about my experience since graduating - this has been a realllly long exploration. Tried out so many things!
