I know I've been absent, not as much around as I'd have liked to be - I have been tangled - still am...as someone in alien traditions and society... exploring hte world of opportunity and carefully, and as prodigiously as an ant marking what I *would* like to do
and then with a heavy heart prioritizing what I need to do..embrace minimalism...

don't mistake your peers of today as your future - Try to find your tribe and until you hear these words - ring like a clear bell in your mind - you haven't understood them. You've read them, sure - not understood them. The understanding 
would be without words, it'd be wordless... that's when you've realized your tribal identity - speak it once - softly - my tribe!

for survival - that was true when there were only 2000 of us - when the average age was 30 - but you and I love - we are blessed and alive - we can choose to be free - and not just the victim of times - counteless generations have been lost in wars - survival- you and I are blessed - make it count! 

I know there's been a lot of confusion - numbness - it numbs - but fall in love with life... 


the tail of human mind is it's mind! And let that sink in!

Don't fret about finding the "one" - that would be your gravest mistake till you actually become - yourself- and it's not defined by the lines on your hand/ your forehead / marks but your choices.. choose who you are!


If you fear being yourself- being alone - the moment you define yourself - I'm your greatest fan! You have earned my respect, above all you have earned your own respect - you'd forget "shame" and be as busy as a child at play - that's the ideal work - when it's just as fun as play

dream...do something different...choose something that defines you - an archeologist ( no less than sherlock holmes ) - a historian ( an egyptologist ) - an author - a linguist - a poet - a journalist... no such thing as a "dumb" profession - there's no hierarchy in work - in life - only what we convice ourselves of - it's your job to take it to unprecedented heights! - god forbid - politics! ( whyy??)


live dangerously! Not in the casual sense of the word but take big decisions from your heart - something you can't live without...

I know your blood runs hot - it runs thick - no doubt - we share the same blood...

Foster a love of simplicity for it is the ultimate elegance, beauty - minimal! Don't dream about travelling the world to see - to be bemused! Travel, to grow! To be more as a person - then who went on the trip in the first place.

try not to live dreams of someone else - life is too short for your own dream - unbearably long for someone else's ...

do not take the way of life for granted - this will sound harsh but don't you find it amusing that a driving license/ drinking but not for making babies - not that's not your birthright - there are already too many of us - please do spare the world some broken familiies - a human child is dangerous - the most potent weapon ever - 
a child looks up to it's parents - are you a good role model? - are you even yourself? - a work-in-progress person creates broken families - family can be your greatest strength - but it ought to be only after, the you, you have so persistently realized - made - you're going to be someone's hero - become your own first! That's all I have to say about it)

make it a point to let people "earn" your respect - it's a luxury - those you respect have immense influence in your life - in your thoughts - don't just follow the crowd - think for yourself - be critical and once you do respect - do your best to be loyal - be courteous - that's something you should cherish - but let people earn your faith - I can't recommend  the balace - it's precisely the details that you must figure out yourself - there is no recipe to life - no algorithm - to "safe/secure"

never take anything that remotely resembles " because I say so " - you're my blood - let it boil at such mindless thoughts and sentiments..

you have a voice - "aawaz" - dont be a part of cacophony - a noise - find yourself - find your tribe and sing! Sing and dance to that melody that you can hear - that special rhythm that the entire universe conspired for you - sing and dance!

the world is going crazy with information - you hvae one thing to guide yoruself- taste - tribe - your own beliefs - if you are predujiced - take news and opinions as truts - I might not say it out loud but you'll definitely know - i'm disappointed! 

a human being is the greatest thing in universe - it's not the body - but the mind that's the crown jewel of nature's design...use it!

it's not the *hip* but only the innately naive - simple - that must be your focus... above all *read* - it's the one habit that's gonna be your making! This is what we do - we build on someone else's work - we stand on shoulders of giants!  - things which are momentary pleasure - *rush* is not one of them!

there's absolutely no thought that hasn't been thought atleast twice - no words which haven't -

question your notions of birth-right! Think about your legacy - live healthy -and question - what you do - does it matter for anyone beyond your lifespan - take the greatest in any field - sports - arts - science - their legacy, they added to the human spirit - inspired a thousand more
acknowldge and relish in the fact that you'll be surpassed someday - you're my blood - you better set the bar high!  This is what we do as a species - we grow and we surpass - contribute as much as you can - "you'll always know what's the right thing to do" - foster discipline - it's not an iron - but it's precisely not giving up on being disciplined - that counts - 


think of the heart - mother god created the perfect world - she thought --- life isn't lived with logic - only understood  with logic ---- and when you do know something / someone  - it seeps into your very bones - it's wordless... that's the target - the goal - to be one with something - that it becomes a part of you - an of dreams and hard work persitence - and the strength of undedrstanding... *read* lives - events of the past - you'll be amuzed at the present and still be hopeful for the future - be that light that the we need for the future... dont' be *foo* ... earn your wisdom ! 

Make mistakes - no one ever - was perfect - you are meant to make mistakes - make them count - edison and sachin and then there's a serial criminal -  you get the point! 


the greatest compliemnet I've ever recieved is " you're as curious as a new born child - in love with everything and everyone " - make it your own! this is the best time to be alive!


not only to my siblings - not only to the sorry Indian middle class-- to the greater family-- to you who found yourself "questioning"  ( resonating ) --- it's for you - we are siblings - the same tribe --- don't be one of those who sigh at long lost dreams.


dont' every let petty sentiments like nationalism cloud your mind - do not limit your heritage -your'e Indian - that's a part of your identity but a very small part - rest would be your choices - your heritage is not from your grandfather but right from the very first cell - life - to learn and to contribute - that is your birthright - your moral duty - all cultures are your heirtage - yes the good and the bad - it runs all the same in our blood--


P.S. if you find yourself in the labyrinth of fallacy etc ... read philosophy - western - eastern- central - That is your heritage and your birthright ...
