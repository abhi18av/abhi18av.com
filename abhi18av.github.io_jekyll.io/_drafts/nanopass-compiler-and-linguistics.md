I feel nanopass holds a great promise for exploring the language, there's something deeply fundamental to the way we build abstractions be it computer programming languages or human languages...

I have trouble being opinionated...and apparently that's the thing that makes for good opinions...

Instead I'd like to tell you to become problem oriented, if anythong..and leanrn the basic fundamentals and embrace the best tools for the job..Racket is the one for me...you might prefer something different...
