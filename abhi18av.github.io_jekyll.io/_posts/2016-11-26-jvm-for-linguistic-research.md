The JVM ( Java Virtual Machine ) is a fantastic platform!

You get to use the same underlying techniques, methods, algorithms with the languages which facilitates problem solving from the git go! You know, I've experimented with languages like Haskell, Rust, C++ and of course JavaScript - to name the most popular ones. The biggest challenge I faced as a beginner in these languages was the vastly different documentation, in addition to the syntax and niche. So, maybe (even sub-consciously) I started looking for some sense of uniformity with my workflow.

The problem is essentially reduced to the best way of exploring a problem, looking at it from so the viewpoint which reduces it to something simple and avoids the incidental complexity introduced by the *way* we do things. And once the problem has been explored and understood well enough, solidified as it seems to me. We can code it up using the "industrial standard" Java language or one of the JVM heavyweights like Scala and Clojure.

Unlike C/C++ java is less of a niche language - in the sense that, the use of C/C++ has mostly remained popular in Game Development and memory-intensive tasks or say even construction of Virtual Machines like JVM, C/C++ are hardly the ideal languages to *explore computing* which requires a certain level of abstraction.

Plus it's not as if we have to give up game development in Java, there actually are fantastic game engines in Java like JMonkeyEngine, LWGL and the most popular one being LibGDX. Though, to be honest C++ is the lingua franca of the two most popular and recently open-sourced game engines like Unreal Engine and CryEngine. And how can we forget the ever-more popular Unity engine which chose to go with the C# (.NET world). But I'd say depending upon the needs of a solo game designer or explorer Java is a much better option than .NET ( well, maybe for the next 10 years atleast ;P ).


The JVM languages which I find to be insanely awesome and useful ( subjective, I know ) give me the freedom to choose the best tool for the job and yet staying really close to practicality in skills and essence which essentially is an argument against relying too much on Racket language (in my case) - which is an absolutely brilliant piece of work and a joy to use but it doesn't pay off in the *real world*.


For my Linguistic work on the JVM I definitely need

Jruby       - Python/ Ruby
Scala       - F#
Clojure     - Racket ( LISP )
Frege       - Haskell
Java        - Java :p


For the non-JVM languages *Python* or rather *Anaconda* is the one I absolutely love! Btw, if you find yourself really hoping to work with the .NET - I highly recommend the Clojure and F# combination

Coming back to JVM, it's a fantastic technology and yes, it's a complex ecosystem and a constantly evolving environment (with not so popular Tech. Giant at the top) (with not so popular Tech. Giant at the top) (with not so popular Tech. Giant at the top) (with not so popular Tech. Giant at the top) (with not so popular Tech. Giant at the top) (with not so popular Tech. Giant at the top) (with not so popular Tech. Giant at the top) (with not so popular Tech. Giant at the top) (with not so popular Tech. Giant at the top) - but it's fun to learn within a familiar ecosystem. For any of these JVM languages, there's the vary same JavaDoc that serves the purpose - Sweet!

I hope that the academia is listening, it sure uses all these languages alot, for various contexts like industrial research and programming language design I'm absoltely fascinated by the jvm now, enchanted by the JVM and the possibilities it opens up for me.

Did I mention that with Clojure  you get ClojureScript for free! Boom - no JavaScript for
large projects, maybe a few snippets here and there but largely you'd be completely liberated. Oh, there's ScalaJS as well which relies on the fantastic features of the Scala language design and brings it to the web. I just looks a lot more tasteful to me than TypeScript or anything else - apart from ClojureScript that is.
