We as language lovers and linguists, cherish the ability to Using multiple scripts and languages we come in touch everyday and running across some font or language which can't be handleded by our text editors or programs is a major turn-off.

Should we always wait for Microsoft or Google or some such to add support for a new language - often without any idea when it's gonna happen? Oh c'mon, we're better than that.

If you ever find yourself dabbling in more than one language ( or say 4 or more) then I have the perfect gift for you! Do have a look at Spacemacs!

Apart from every imaginable keyboard configuration for all scripts there's a wonderful IPA mode in Spacemacs, in with have-your-preferences baked right in.

- Vanilla IPA mode
- IPA-kirshenbaum mode
- IPA-x-sampa ( Using J.C. Wells' X-SAMPA )
