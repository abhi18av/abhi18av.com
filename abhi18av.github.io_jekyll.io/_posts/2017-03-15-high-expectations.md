Yesterday,Â I as informed that my application and current qualifications aren't upto the expectations of the Institute. I was sad initially but maybe certain things are beginnings, with the face-lift of the dreaded *end*.

I'll put this up here, this is something I feel dissapointed with and by inclination don't we only share our successes. Well, I'd like to keep this memory of my failure as well - they're are just as important.

The Examinations Board of the Master of Logic has carefully examined your application for the Master of Logic 2017-2019 and decided not to admit you to this programme.

Some further details can be found in the attached letter.



I am sorry to have to tell you this.

The accompanying PDF being

```
The Master of Logic is a highly challenging programme for training students to become researchers in logic, language and computation. It leaves no room to make up for deficiencies.

Unfortunately the fact that your undergraduate degree has no direct relevance to the Master of Logic in combination with both your background in formal logic and your past academic performance did not convince the Examinations Board that you will be able to succeed in this programme.

I've always had this crazy dream of being able to understand symbols, maths and to understand that unconditional truth that it entails. My experience has taught me that I am quite persistent but perhaps not good at all at accepting things.


My response pretty much summed up my thoughts and plans.

I understand, and accept, the decision taken by the examinations board regarding my application.

However, I would like to inquire whether it's possible to apply again next year?

I do know it's possible but I certainly can't change my past academic grades. My question is, if I work hard enough on the foundational courses would the committee be willing to weigh it against my past grades?

And, if possible, would any faculty member be able to grace me with a clear answer so as to how can I carve out an achievable goal for the duration of this year?

I am aware that the syllabus and time-table is publicly available. Is it possible to find/gain-access to the previous year examinations papers on the internet or by post?


The reason I ask these questions is that this course is the perfect one that I can think for myself as all other courses are either too inclined towards Linguistic-IT/Computer Science and I'll most likely end up being bored through the duration of the course again.
```

I'll continue with the course preparations, if I recieve even the slightest guidance from the Institute ( IILC, Amsterdam) and prepare using the *Undergraduate Text in Mathematics - Springer* series but if there isn't any response then I will still most likely do the series in my free time, thought not with the objective of pursuing my Masters but rather only for curiosity.

I'll re-orient my career towards BioInformatics ( Genomics).

I'm glad to say they replied!

Honestly, speaking this is way more than you'd expect from Indian academia.

Dear Abhinav,

You are welcome to reapply in the future, and if your application contains new elements, the Admissions Board will evaluate it again.

The criteria that were decisive for the negative decision in your case were academic excellence and logic background. You cannot do much to ameliorate your past grades, so the only thing you can do is work hard on your logic background by following advanced Mathematical Logic courses covering the completness proof of first-order predicate logic and more. If you pass these courses with outstanding grades, and you manage to provide us with some evidence of your academic excellence (publications/grants//awards etc) you could have a chance.

We do not distribute past examinations, but you can have a look at our theses to get an idea of what our students learn: https://www.illc.uva.nl/MScLogic/theses/index.php?showarchive=1

I wish you lots of success with your future academic career.
