Today, I've *officially* started working on two of language oriented projects which were brewing in my mind for a while. I introduce you to 
[taal-clj](https://github.com/abhi18av/taal-clj), which is a language learning tool I'm building and [kotoba-clj](https://github.com/abhi18av/kotoba-clj) the purpose of which is to 
explore the computational generation of langauges i.e. a tool for Constructed Languages. 

I'll discuss my hopes with these two projects in brief, here. For fresh updates please do visit the repositories I've setup for these projects.

1. Taal

  This is the Dutch word for "Language, Speech" and as I hope to pursue my education in Netherlands, I thought it might be a good idea if I explore the language on my own. I've 
  decided to learn two languages till the time of scholarship application.
   
   - Dutch
   - Chinese
   
   I've had some experience of learning languages previously and this time I do wish to create something more personal, learn from my own material and in a way that makes me better.
   
2.  Kotoba
  
  This is the Japanese word for languages :) 
  
  I've always wanted to use this word so what better way than to name something I am passionate about after this beautiful word, mmm, now that 
  I think about it - I do love words a lot. THere's something about them, something magical!
  
  So, it's my hope that this tool will be useful in exploration of languages, theoretical as well as practical work would be built upon this little repo. If this gains momentum *and* if I make enough mistakes, this just might become an excellent tool for teaching.
  
  I'm definitely not in favor of relying on Statistical Analysis of languages, so far as we want to understand the principles behind the magic of languages. I've been thinking about it a lot lately,
  and, to be sure, I know the value of Stochastic techniques but it just *feels* wrong at so many levels. I can give so many examples and, to be sure, there'd be as many counter examples so I'll just say be honest with my uneasy feelings towards this aspect of linguistic research.
