A couple days ago I ran the `history` command on the CLI and the latest count of showed `1009` commands! It might seem like a minor thing, maybe it is for the ones who have mastered the magic of computing, of using this wonderful magical wand to make it do wonders - limited only by their imagination. This 10,000 CLI mark is momentous for me, as I wish to become of those who can express their will precisely to the machine and change it to somthing that facilitates their work, rather than being this abstract hinderance.

The words might seem too romantic but, if anything, I'll leave the task of trying to present the beauty of command line to someone who has done a superb job already - [In the beginning was the Command Line - Neal Stephenson](http://cristal.inria.fr/~weis/info/commandline.html). If you wish to know why this simple, "old-fashioed" way of doing things is still relevant, all the more relevant, then you would love this essay. Mind you it's a long one but there's a lot of surreal humor and beautiful insights in the essay. When I read it, I absolutely fell in love with it!

As I've pointed out often in my [sagematics](https://sagematics.blogspot.in) blog over the course of last year, I intend to live on the CLI as much as possible and to get things done as quickly as possible. I love computers but there's no point trying to overlook the fact that the lifestyle around computers is not healthy, it's an occupational hazard. So, I seek to only implement the solutions and experiment a bit while I'm on the machine and do it within the shortest time possible. 

I guess, it's still a long way from that "Life in the CLI" ideal but I've notived that I do find the GUI based traversal quite annoying now. Maybe, I'll reach the ideal of living on the CLI sooner than I thought :)
