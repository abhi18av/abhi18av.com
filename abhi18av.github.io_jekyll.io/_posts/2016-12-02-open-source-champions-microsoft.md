I'm quite sure that for most of the world, the computer software meant pretty much the Microsoft logo at startup. That's how we grew up, with Microsoft - Apple was a luxury and Linux was something that only "techies" did. The impact of Microsoft has been so widespread that ever more popular softwares like MS Word, PowerPoint etc are pretty much synonyms for word editing and presentation softwares.

But Microsoft's history attitude has always been that of "my way or the highway". It basically gave a not-so-generous hand gesture to the Open Source world and guarded the inevitable bugs in it's software as something that happens only with *"lesser companies"*. Needless to say that such an attitude is fundamentally elitist, denied equality and above all promoted intellectual dishonesty. But those were the days of the past...

Fast forward to 2016, Google and Facebook have become the darlings of the Open Source world through their commitment in sharing the advances they make with code, the solutions that they have come up for various problems. Things like ReactJS and TensorFlow which basically **are** at the core these giants - they've shared it with the world as well. Sharing the source opens it up to endless possibilities of improvements and above all it provides a huge incentive for people to learn and contribute in making the code even better!

The thing is, Microsoft missed out on so many things with Mobile, Scientific and dotNet - Microsoft made so many promising technologies and starts but it was the attitude of "it's my way" that took them out of the good graces of public. 

I'm really happy to have seen how the policies and attitude of the this Giant has changed, for the better. Now it's *the* most heavyweight contributor to open source on Github and it continues to provide free up baseline products like Visual Studio and  dotNet!

As I mentioned in the previous post, it's this wonderful attitude towards the community that can help Microsoft become that beloved tech. giant that it's supposed to be. The world is too neatly divided between Google and Facebook there days and we know that healthy competition does everyone some good!
