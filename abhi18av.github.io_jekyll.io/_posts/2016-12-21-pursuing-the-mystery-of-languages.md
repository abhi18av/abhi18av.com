Hii everyone!

It's been a while since I last updated you guys on what I'm upto these days
and trust me, I've been working really hard to find a solution to this *analysis paralysis* , as it applies to my needs and goals. As I write this, I feel that this one will be an echo of my innermost thoughts and the hard decisions I've made to pursue this goal - understanding languages.

I feel that there're only a few places left for mankind to be those glorious explorers again - Biology, Space, the Deep Seas and the Mind.

Recently, I attented my convocation and got the degree that *makes* me an engineer. I met so many friends and I wasn't entirely happy, I felt deeply anxious. You see, as a 20-something I.T. graduate the *traditional and easy*
career path for me would be to just join an I.T. firm, code for a couple years and then start climbing the organization hierarchy. I could pursue my education in a much more *"acceptable"* way by going for an M.B.A degree. Give or take 4-5 years I'd be married and off to this journey called family-life. And I was involved with a startup in my last year in University, but I've elaborate on that in some other post - the gist is, it wasn't meaningful enough for *me* - not profound enough to make me work harder that I ever did.

That's exactly the path that almost *all* of my friends and acquiantances took, right now the best possible near-sighted situation ( **the reality** for neighbors and relatives) is that my friends are moving forward in their careers while I'm at home trying to pursue something that few can understand. And I won't deny that it's hard, it's a hot-bed for insecurity and not-so-healthy feelings and the mind does wander away into this *comparative* mode of thinking, putting me against everyone. It doesn't help that I've always been competitive by nature. But, I hold my breadth and I'm still onto this goal to understand languages.

The thing is, sure I can have a really convenient life, a job or business position that gives me *social-stature* but I've never been the one to neglect that naive feeling of *there must be something more*! Foolish, though it may seem but this one desire has always been my North star, this desire to be contribute to something greater, to experience profundity has been the thought that drives me - often crazy - but eventually forward.

Sure, I have the very same skill-set that one needs to make all this awesome stuff that technology brings to our lives but, to me that's like building toys for short-lived amusement. Sure, it's outrageously hilarious but seldom ... profound.

In terms of what I feel I've accomplished so far since the time at Uni.
it's been a mixed feeling as I've failed a lot! One of the reason being I've tried a lot many things, different things like

- What exactly I wish to do in Linguistics.
- Above all **Learning how to Read Code**

I've geniunely put a wager on my career and IILC is *exactly* what I want, let me put it out in unambigious terms - "I need the scholarship to study Logic and Language in Amsterdam, I shall complete my masters from IILC"

Right now, I've thoroughly understood the value of *using the right tool for the job* and *having preferences* for programming languages and technology - *not obsessions*.

And what I've learned that even though there are a few trade-offs involved with platforms like JVM and dotNET, like wise with languages like Julia, Haskell, Ruby etc. I need to weigh my options in terms of how well I can create a coherent set of integrated and *practical* tools which help me understand and explore languages in the most lucid and fluid way.

Working on creating a couple projects - funneled down after a lot of random walks. And the major focus is of course laying the foundations for a way to ask questions from a language in a meaningful way.

Learning Chinese and Dutch using every possible thing I can think of - I'll start posting things in Chinese and Dutch soon enough. I must become good as fast as I can, the scholarship is my best shot forward. I can't say there won't be failures but, damn **Truth be told, I'm dead set on this one thing, I'll make it come true.**
