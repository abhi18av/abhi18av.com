I've published a repo on the [Linguistics-DTU](https://github.com/Linguistics-DTU/Programming_For_Linguists) repo which sort of, contains all the Linguistics related work that I've done or I'm doing at the moment.

I find that even though I have this tag of a Computer Science graduate - I honestly, don't understand computing. It's like that feeling of trying to learn a language for a while and realizing that so far, one only understands the language only passively.

I've been thinking a lot about Computing, Language-learning and my future lately. I feel immensely curious about being able to use Computing to understand ourselves.
