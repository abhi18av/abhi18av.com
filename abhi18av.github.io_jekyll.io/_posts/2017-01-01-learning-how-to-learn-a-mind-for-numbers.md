Today, I've completed the Coursera Course "Learning How to Learn"

This course is really special!

I've loved every idea that Barbara Oakley and Terrence Sejnowski put forward. The most memorable for me were the priceless interviews - every "High Achievers" got there only because of hard work. Sure, some might have a head start in something but it's _*always*_ the case that special thing known by many names - grit, perseverence, will ...

My goal for 2017 is to become a "Learning Machine"
 - master languages, both human and computer ones.

Learning is great, but often we forget that - it's supposed to be fun!

- Happy Learning and a Happy New Year :)
