Finally, it's happening! I've been really on the lookout for a good course for pursuing my masters, hoping to find something which is right on the sweet spot between Mathematics, Computation and Linguistics. Well, there's one in Amsterdam, Netherlands.

I've asked Google so many questions and every single time it leads to a select few countries - Netherlands, U.S.A, Germany and U.K. - this does makes me wonder why isn't the fascination with Languages more encouraged in soo many places? Ah well, we don't change things by musing about them.

Actually there are many courses in Netherlands as far as Linguistics is concerned but there's this special one in [University of Amsterdam, IILC](https://www.illc.uva.nl/MScLogic/)

So, I'm gonna continue from where I've left off my blogs [TheTalkingApes](https://thetalkingapes.blogspot.in/) and [Sagematics](https://sagematics.blogspot.in/). When I read back the posts, my own thoughts from a year back I see a lot of confusion regarding, what I'm actually doing at any given moment! And It'd be unrealistic on my part to even try to cover all that up :)

But towards the end of those blogs I was becoming more and more engaged with this passion of mine - to use Language and Computation, to find something to work on. Fortunately, even the *"failure"* I've had with the brief StartUp stint is in retrospect only helpful towards this cause.

I've always known that I'm definitely not made for a *"Job"* and through this StartUp experience I've realized about myself that I'd much rather do the job myself than attend a bunch of meetings, I educated myself about the StartUp world and culture as best as I could, YCombinator blogs, Podcasts and a lot of books but during all of that I truly overlooked what I do enjoy doing and that's, of course, Linguistics. I do have that StartUp bug in me and I feel that it's really exiting thing to do but maybe not now, I lack the skills to be able to make a prototype myself or even how to design systems - above all I lack like-minded people whom I can really connect with. And on the other hand I had this colossal college project which I so thouroughly enjoyed doing! The one thing that I took away from both these experiences is that, to thrive, we need an environment of passionate people with iron determination.

Initially my plan was to go for a Masters Degree in 2017 but after walking away from the startup - and a couple months of dis-orientedness I realized that if I'm to really give my best to Linguistics as a career I better get started.

So, in this blog you'll find a my journey towards the Masters in Netherlands. I swear, I've never felt this driven since I aimed for D.T.U to complete my Engineering in. This is it!
