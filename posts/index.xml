<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="hey-you-reader">Hey you, reader!</h2>
<p>Putting aside my reluctance to introduce myself publicly, I‚Äôm starting this journey for basically three reasons:</p>
<p><strong>1. First</strong>, because it might help you at some point in your professional journey, whether through my mistakes or my achievements;</p>
<p><strong>2. Second</strong>, because you might want to join one of the study groups I run on weekends, either in Portuguese or English (more details here);</p>
<p><strong>3. Finally</strong>, because we might create or join a new and exciting initiative for society. How great would that be?</p>
<p>Well, let‚Äôs move on to the proper introductions, professionally speaking. After all, we are not defined by our degrees ‚Äî they are just an important part of life, but not <em>the</em> most important one‚Ä¶</p>
<p>My name is Emilyn Costa Concei√ß√£o Sharma, and I‚Äôm from Bel√©m, Par√°, Brazil. Despite the challenges my family and educators faced in getting me interested in studying during childhood, their persistence worked ‚Äî and here I am.</p>
<p>After a not-so-traditional journey, I fell in love with knowledge, and it became like magic chocolate: the more I consumed, the more there was to enjoy.<br>
At that time, I had no internet, cellphone, or even TV access. My entire knowledge source came from formal education (school) and informal education (my grandmother‚Äôs library ‚Äî she was a teacher). I went through many schools, experienced bullying, traumas, new beginnings, and later, found places that became emotional, intellectual, social, and protective oases.</p>
<p>This background made me want to be everything at once.<br>
Teenage years brought intense passions: for history, I wanted to be a historian; for music, a musician; for physics, I dreamed of NASA; for religion, I considered becoming a theologian or religious scholar; for sociology, geography, literature, and‚Ä¶ biology. Eventually, I had to choose just two paths.</p>
<p>My choices were led by the desire to serve God and His creation through what challenged and fascinated me.<br>
First, I chose Medicine ‚Äî because I love people and wanted to care for them.<br>
Second, I chose Biology Education ‚Äî a unique union between Science and Teaching.<br>
I love life, the diversity of life, and the paradoxical harmony between its simplicity and complexity.</p>
<p>And what came of these choices? Here‚Äôs a summary of my short professional biography, copied and pasted from a recent conference where I was a speaker:</p>

<p>‚ÄúEmilyn holds a Biology degree from the Federal University of Par√° (UFPA), with internships through CIEE and later through a scientific research project (PIBIC/CNPq) at the Molecular Biology Laboratory of the Bacteriology and Mycology Section at the Evandro Chagas Institute (SABMI/IEC), with which she maintains collaboration to this day. She earned a Master‚Äôs degree in Infectious Diseases from the State University of Par√° (UEPA) and a PhD in Microbiology from the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ), with a ‚Äòsandwich‚Äô research period at Paris-Sud University, France, in collaboration with the Laboratory of Molecular Biology Applied to Mycobacteria (LABMAM) at the Oswaldo Cruz Institute ‚Äì Fiocruz (IOC/Fiocruz).<br>
She worked as a research technologist at Fiotec, in the Bacteriology and Bioassays Laboratory of the National Institute of Infectious Diseases (INI/Fiocruz), a regional reference in mycobacteria, where she gained experience in clinical research and molecular biology diagnostics for mycobacteria. She participated in the clinical projects Phoenix-NIH, TB-Alliance, and Report-Brazil.<br>
Since 2021, she has been a member of the TB Genomics and Tuberculosis Omics Research (TORCH) groups, mainly coordinating the SMARTT clinical research project as a postdoctoral fellow at Stellenbosch University, Cape Town, South Africa.<br>
Her current research focuses on personalized medicine through genomic sequencing of patients with drug-resistant tuberculosis.<br>
Her interests include public health, epidemiology, molecular biology, antimicrobial resistance, genomic surveillance, ‚Äòomics‚Äô, bioinformatics, and science education.‚Äù</p>

<p>To wrap up this introduction, a poetic reminder:<br>
Research work demands an incredible sense of urgency.<br>
Everything feels like it‚Äôs for ‚Äúyesterday,‚Äù and we live buried under deadlines.<br>
Proactivity, creativity, and resilience are almost like components of our oxygen molecule.</p>
<p>Maybe that‚Äôs why I want to share my favorite poem here ‚Äî as a reminder that, even in the rush of life, we shouldn‚Äôt forget to appreciate its tiny little wonders.</p>

<p><em>(Manoel de Barros)</em></p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>I use words to compose my silences.<br>
I don‚Äôt like words worn out by information.<br>
I have more respect for those that live belly-down on the ground ‚Äî like water, stones, frogs.<br>
I understand the accent of the waters.<br>
I respect unimportant things and unimportant beings.<br>
I value insects more than airplanes.<br>
I value the speed of turtles more than missiles.<br>
I carry a natural slowness in me.<br>
I was made to love little birds.<br>
And I‚Äôm abundantly happy because of that.<br>
My backyard is bigger than the world.<br>
I am a catcher of waste:<br>
I love leftovers like good flies do.<br>
I wish my voice had the shape of a song.<br>
Because I‚Äôm not from informatics ‚Äî I‚Äôm from inventiveness.<br>
I only use words to compose my silences.</p>
