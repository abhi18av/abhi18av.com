## Short Professional Bio

Hi, I’m Emilyn Costa Conceição Sharma — a biologist by training 🧬, a microbiologist by passion 🔬, and someone who spends a suspicious amount of time thinking about bacteria most people can’t even pronounce 😄.

I graduated in Biological Sciences from the Federal University of Pará (UFPA) in 2010 🎓, earned my master’s in Parasitic Biology in the Amazon from the State University of Pará (UEPA) in 2012 🦠, and completed my PhD in Microbiology at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ) in 2018 📘. I also had the chance to spend an exciting year as a visiting PhD student at Université Paris Sud (2015–2016) — oui, baguettes and bacteria 🥖🇫🇷!

After that, I did a postdoc in Clinical Research on Infectious Diseases at the Evandro Chagas National Institute of Infectious Diseases, part of the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (INI/Fiocruz), from 2020 to 2021 🧪. Since 2021, I’ve been based in South Africa 🇿🇦, working as a postdoctoral fellow in the Division of Molecular Biology and Human Genetics at Stellenbosch University.

My research is rooted in both basic and applied sciences 🔍, with a special focus on medical and environmental microbiology. I have a particular fascination for the Mycobacteria world — which includes Mycobacterium tuberculosis (a-ha! The TB villain 😷), Non-Tuberculous Mycobacteria (NTM), and Mycobacterium leprae (yes, the one behind Hansen Disease).
