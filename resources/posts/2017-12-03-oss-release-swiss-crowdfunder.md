As part of our [ongoing effort](/opensource.html) in giving back to the open source
community, we are happy to announce that we just released our newest
product - [Swiss Crowdfunder](http://swiss-crowdfunder.com/) - as open
source community edition.

## Why did we do it?

Crowdfunding using established platforms can be very expensive.
Usually, there is a fee of 12-20% that has to be paid. **Swiss
Crowdfunder** is fully open source - therefore it can be used by anyone to
start their own crowdfunding platform or campaign.

## Open source

**Swiss Crowdfunder** is released under the popular
[ AGPL license ](https://github.com/200ok-ungleich/swiss-crowdfunder/blob/master/LICENSE),
has a
[contribution guide](https://github.com/200ok-ungleich/swiss-crowdfunder/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
as well as a
[code of conduct](https://github.com/200ok-ungleich/swiss-crowdfunder/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md),
is
[fully configurable](https://github.com/200ok-ungleich/swiss-crowdfunder#configuration)
and has a community
[Mattermost chatroom](https://github.com/200ok-ungleich/swiss-crowdfunder#configuration).
