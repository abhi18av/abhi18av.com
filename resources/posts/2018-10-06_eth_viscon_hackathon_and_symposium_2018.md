The ETH society for students studying Computer Science
([VIS](https://vis.ethz.ch/en/current/home/) has invited Alain to
serve as a mentor during this years 3 day [Hackathon / Symposium](https://viscon.vis.ethz.ch/).

The Hackathon is fully booked with about a hundred participants. So
far, it has been an awesome event! From the obvious points like the
location (ETH), to catering (round the clock fresh food and drinks) and
the friction-less and professional organization, it was just a great
way to spend the weekend.

Here are some impressions:
