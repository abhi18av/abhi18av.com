    How to supercharge your development setup with true code hot-reloading in a truly functional programming language.

This is a talk Alain gave at the [Web Zueri Meetup in Zurich,
Switzerland](https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/Web-Zurich/events/252786883)
on July 24, 2018.

The complexity of software is growing at an exponential rate. The
biggest challenge is the *growing complexity* of *dynamic state* which
makes it hard to reason about a system. There are many paradigms
aiming to ease the situation. To reduce incidental complexity
"Functional Programming" and "Code Hot-Reloading" have become much
talked about topics in the web development community. 

In this talk, Alain shows how to supercharge your development setup
with true code hot-reloading in a truly functional programming
language.
