[Hack4Glarus](https://hack4glarus.ch/) is the first hackathon of
Glarus. Hack4Glarus is hosted by our partner company
[ungleich glarus ag](https://ungleich.ch/). This will be the third
incarnation and it will be on the weekend from 2018-11-30 until
2018-12-02.

We from 200ok will be there as well - as are our friends from the
[Insopor Zen Academy](http://zen-temple.net/). Join us for three great
days of hacking, fun and learning!

Last time we built and released our open source Crowdfunding and and Equity
funding platform [Swiss Crowdfunder](project/swiss-crowdfunder.html)
which was immediately successfully used to raise over a quarter million
Swiss franks for the [Data Center Light](https://datacenterlight.ch/).
The event itself was really successful and we got a
[great article in the newspaper Südostschweiz about 200ok and ungleich](posts/200ok-in-the-media.html). 

Join the event now on the [dedicated page](https://hack4glarus.ch/) or
on [ Meetup ](https://www.meetup.com/Digital-Glarus-Business-Technology/events/252626305/).
