At 200ok, we automate all of the repetitive Admin tasks like
invoicing, bookkeeping, payroll and tracking time to customer systems.
Those specific four tasks are all based on the time that we spend
working. Everyone at 200ok tracks time with their favorite tool, but
then exports it in a standardized format - a CSV file.

Today, we open sourced our tool to synchronize a time CSV sheet to
[letsfreckle.com](https://letsfreckle.com/): https://gitlab.com/200ok/csv2letsfreckle

We hope it can make your life a little less repetitive and give you
more time to work on your own projects!
