In an collaborative effort with [OpnTec](http://opntec.org/) and
[FossAsia](https://fossasia.org/), [200ok GmbH](https://200ok.ch) has
just open sourced all of the code of the professional live audio
streaming and archiving of events platform
[voicerepublic.com](https://voicerepublic.com) under the GPL license.

The project was originally created in a funded company in which [Phil
and Alain](/team.html) were sharing the role of CTO. Many big
publishers (i.e. [Frankfurter
Buchmesse](https://voicerepublic.com/users/frankfurter-buchmesse),
[Fraunhofer Institute](https://voicerepublic.com/users/Morgenstadt),
[Deutscher
Ethikrat](https://voicerepublic.com/users/deutscher-ethikrat)) have
used the platform in the past to create and distribute their content
in an open manner.

So here it is: https://github.com/voicerepublic/voicerepublic_dev

The ongoing plan is for OpnTec and FossAsia to build a team that runs
[voicerepublic.com](https://voicerepublic.com) as a service and
further develop the platform with the community. 200ok will continue
to be a contributer in building this community and bringing
VoiceRepublic into a new free and open future!

You can join the VoiceRepulic channel here: https://gitter.im/VoiceRepublic/VoiceRepublic

If you're curious and want to hack away on it, a good starting point
is the [vr-devbox](https://github.com/voicerepublic/vr-devbox)
repository which sets up a dev VM using vagrant.
