Short friendly announcement: 200ok has just released it's 3.0 website:
https://200ok.ch

A data-driven (using a self developed
[ OSS filesystem DB ](/project/fsdb.html) as source) static site. The
site is [ built in Clojure and OSS ](/project/200ok-site.html) itself.

We're still working on the styling and adding more data, but we like
to release early and often^^
