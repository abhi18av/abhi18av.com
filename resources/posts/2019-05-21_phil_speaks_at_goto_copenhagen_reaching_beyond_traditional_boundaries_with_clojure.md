## Abstract

Clojure and ClojureScript provide fine-grained control over the state
of a running application. Especially when combined with a reactive
front-end framework like React, features like hot-swapping code reach
far beyond simple live reloading.

Applying a reactive paradigm means that changing the data updates the
user interface. Clojure's functional nature, with its strict
separation of data and code, lets us use the reactive paradigm for
development as well: changing the code updates the user interface.

This works not only in the front end of a development environment.
Using this mechanism over a networked REPL provides the same
capabilities in the back end of a production environment.

In an example-driven approach we will explore several typical
situations in software development in which Clojure helps us to speed
up not only our development cycle but also DevOps.
