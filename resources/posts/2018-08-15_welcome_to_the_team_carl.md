We are very happy to announce our newest team member, Carl Düvel!

Carl has studied computer science with Alain in Stuttgart. Apart from
that, Carl and Alain already started working together professionally
on their first serious startup MVP close to 10 years ago. It's a great
pleasure that he's adding his expertise to the 200ok team, now! In fact,
we're a little late in writing this post as he already started in
July^^

Carl is an independent IT-Consultant from Northern Germany who holds a
BA in Politics and Public Administration as well as in Applied
Computer Science. He worked for nearly a decade in the software
industry starting out his career on applications servers slinging J2EE
code and just a few years ago falling in love with programming again
through the power of Lisp or more specifically Clojure. He also enjoys
operations work and has spent a considerate time working in a high
traffic, high availability and very cloudy environment.
