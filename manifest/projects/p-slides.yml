  ### Simple semantic slides

  p_slides is a *static files only*, dead simple way, to create
  semantic slides. It neither needs a server, installed software,
  pre-compilation nor a special editor. Neither editing nor
  presenting has any external dependencies - it's just a html file.

  - Only think about content, don't worry about styling

  - Static files only, no need for a server, installed software, pre-compilation or a special editor (unless of course your favorite and very special editor!)

  - For editing and presenting, there are no external dependencies

  - It's just a html file (therefore it can easily be put into version control for example)

  - Extendable and supporting themes

  - Write slides in markdown

  p_slides is used in various courses at [Zurich University of
  Applied Sciences](http://zhaw.ch) and is a quite popular project
  on [Github](https://github.com/munen/p_slides).
