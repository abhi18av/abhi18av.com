  Webhooks is a lightweight webhooks server written in Clojure. It
  allows to set up webhook endpoints and corresponding shell
  commands, which will be executed when the endpoint is
  requested. The config file is written in EDN (the preferred
  clojure data format). The config file will be read per request, so
  there is no restart required after updating the config file.
