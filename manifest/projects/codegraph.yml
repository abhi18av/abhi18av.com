  Generates a dependency graph for Clojure and ClojureScript code.
description: >-
  Codegraph is a command utility written in about 50 lines of
  Clojure. It reads Clojure code with Clojure's builtin function
  `read-string`, analyzes the code and generates a dot file, which
  can be fed into Graphviz to generate a dependency graph of the
  given code. It works nicely with ClojureScript. And it's a
  beautiful demonstration of Clojure's homoiconicity (which is a
  fancy technical term for "code is data").
