  Pseudocult (which is an anagram to "cloud setup") enables you to
  set up your cloud (AWS) declarativly and consistently.

  It is mainly a clojure program that you run providing one or more
  config files, which describe your cloud setup. Pseudocult will
  detect discrepancies between the current state of the cloud and
  the description obtained from the config files as well as take
  action to overcome the discrepencies.
