description: >-
  A library management application that we developed as a
  contribution to library organised by volunteers. Wittbib has the
  ability to scan ISBN numbers from a book using a hand scanner to
  look up book meta data in different databases. The books of the
  library can then be searched and lent to visitors. There is also a
  public searching interface as well as various export formats for
  the library.
