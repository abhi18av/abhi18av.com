    Docker is used to run software packages called "containers".
    Containers are isolated from each other and bundle their own
    tools, libraries and configuration files; they can communicate
    with each other through well-defined channels. All containers are
    run by a single operating system kernel and are thus more
    lightweight than virtual machines. Containers are created from
    "images" that specify their precise contents. Images are often
    created by combining and modifying standard images downloaded from
    repositories.

    idea behind it lies in the fact that the environment maintenance
    of virtualizations becomes increasingly difficult in a large
    software development project. Vagrant simplifies the necessary
    software configuration management in order to increase development
    productivity. Vagrant is written in the Ruby language, but its
    ecosystem supports development in almost all major languages.

    Clojure is a dynamic, general-purpose programming language,
    combining the approachability and interactive development of a
    scripting language with an efficient and robust infrastructure for
    multithreaded programming. Clojure is a compiled language, yet
    remains completely dynamic – every feature supported by Clojure is
    supported at runtime. Clojure provides easy access to the Java
    frameworks, with optional type hints and type inference, to ensure
    that calls to Java can avoid reflection.

    Clojure is a dialect of Lisp, and shares with Lisp the
    code-as-data philosophy and a powerful macro system. Clojure is
    predominantly a functional programming language, and features a
    rich set of immutable, persistent data structures. When mutable
    state is needed, Clojure offers a software transactional memory
    system and reactive Agent system that ensure clean, correct,
    multithreaded designs.

    core technologies of World Wide Web content production. It is used
    to make webpages interactive and provide online programs.

    As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven,
    functional, and imperative (including object-oriented and
    prototype-based) programming styles. It has an API for working
    with text, arrays, dates, regular expressions, and basic
    manipulation of the DOM, but the language itself does not include

    OptaPlanner is a constraint satisfaction solver. It optimizes
    business resource planning use cases, such as Vehicle Routing,
    Employee Rostering, Cloud Optimization, Job Scheduling, Bin
    Packing and many more. Every organization faces such scheduling
    puzzles: assign a limited set of constrained resources (employees,
    assets, time and money) to provide products or services to
    customers. OptaPlanner optimizes those planning problems to do
    more business with less resources.

    OptaPlanner is a lightweight, embeddable planning engine. It
    enables normal Java™ programmers to solve optimization problems
    efficiently. Constraints apply on plain domain objects and can
    reuse existing code. There’s no need to input difficult
    mathematical equations. Under the hood, OptaPlanner combines
    sophisticated optimization heuristics and metaheuristics (such as
    Tabu Search, Simulated Annealing and Late Acceptance) with very
    efficient score calculation.

    OptaPlanner is open source software, released under the Apache
    Software License. It is written in 100% pure Java™, runs on any
    JVM and is available in the Maven Central repository too.
