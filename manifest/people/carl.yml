description: >-
  Carl is an independent IT-Consultant from Northern Germany who holds a
  BA in Politics and Public Administration as well as in Applied
  Computer Science. He worked for nearly a decade in the software
  industry starting out his career on applications servers slinging J2EE
  code and just a few years ago falling in love with programming again
  through the power of Lisp or more specifically Clojure. He also enjoys
  operations work and has spent a considerate time working in a high
  traffic, high availability and very cloudy environment.
