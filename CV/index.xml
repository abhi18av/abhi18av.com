<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="key-research-interests">Key research interests</h2>
<p>My key professional interests include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>🧫 Exploring the diversity of Mycobacterium species</strong> through a One Health lens, identifying them in animals, the environment, and clinical samples — part detective work, part microbial safari 🐾🌱.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>🧬 Using molecular epidemiology tools</strong> like spoligotyping and MIRU-VNTR to understand how TB and leprosy spread.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>📊 Studying TB transmission</strong> with a precision health twist, powered by whole genome sequencing (WGS) — it’s like giving TB a DNA test and tracking its every move.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>💊 Investigating how mycobacteria develop resistance to antibiotics</strong>, and comparing what we see in the lab (phenotype) with what’s in their DNA (genotype).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>⚡ Evaluating high-performance, rapid diagnostic tests for TB</strong> including some that work directly from patient samples and are compatible with next-gen sequencing (NGS).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>💻 Developing GEMIBRA</strong>:, the Brazilian Mycobacterial Genome Platform, to support national disease surveillance.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>🧠 Promoting science and health education</strong> by creating educational tools and community engagement strategies — because science should never stay locked in the lab.</p></li>
</ul>

<section id="teaching" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="teaching">Teaching</h2>
<p>Teaching-wise, I also gained experience in higher education between 2012 and 2014 as a lecturer at UFPA and UEPA 🏫, including through Brazil’s national teacher training program (PARFOR/CAPES) 📚.</p>
</section>
<section id="clinical-trials" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="clinical-trials">Clinical trials</h2>
<p>On the clinical side, from 2019 to 2021 I worked in the Bacteriology and Bioassay Lab at INI/Fiocruz 🧫, part of the city’s TB reference lab, contributing to research for the AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) and TB-Alliance as a scientist in diagnostics and clinical research 🧍‍🔬.</p>
<p>In 2021, I took the lead on the SMARTT study (Sequencing Mycobacteria and Algorithm-Determined Resistant Tuberculosis Treatment) 🧪, and now I coordinate a sub-study in South Africa focused on applying WGS for managing drug-resistant TB — it’s called PARR-TB, part of the broader GenPath Africa project 🌍 on pathogen genomics for public health.</p>
</section>
<section id="research-in-brazil" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="research-in-brazil">Research in Brazil</h2>
<p>Back in Brazil 🇧🇷, I co-coordinate the TB Surveillance Network for Northern and Northeastern Brazil (REVIGET N/NE), in collaboration with the Evandro Chagas Institute (IEC), where I’m mainly involved in lab training for WGS workflows, data analysis, and making sure no mycobacterial genome goes unexamined 🔍🧬.</p>
<p>I’m also a proud member of the “Geoprocessing, Health and Environment” research group at IEC 🛰️ — because understanding where diseases happen is just as important as knowing why.</p>
