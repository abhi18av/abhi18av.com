## Key research interests

My key professional interests include:

* **🧫 Exploring the diversity of Mycobacterium species** through a One Health lens, identifying them in animals, the environment, and clinical samples — part detective work, part microbial safari 🐾🌱.

* **🧬 Using molecular epidemiology tools** like spoligotyping and MIRU-VNTR to understand how TB and leprosy spread.

* **📊 Studying TB transmission** with a precision health twist, powered by whole genome sequencing (WGS) — it’s like giving TB a DNA test and tracking its every move.

* **💊 Investigating how mycobacteria develop resistance to antibiotics**, and comparing what we see in the lab (phenotype) with what’s in their DNA (genotype).

* **⚡ Evaluating high-performance, rapid diagnostic tests for TB** including some that work directly from patient samples and are compatible with next-gen sequencing (NGS).

* **💻 Developing GEMIBRA**:, the Brazilian Mycobacterial Genome Platform, to support national disease surveillance.

* **🧠 Promoting science and health education** by creating educational tools and community engagement strategies — because science should never stay locked in the lab.

## Teaching

Teaching-wise, I also gained experience in higher education between 2012 and 2014 as a lecturer at UFPA and UEPA 🏫, including through Brazil’s national teacher training program (PARFOR/CAPES) 📚.

## Clinical trials

On the clinical side, from 2019 to 2021 I worked in the Bacteriology and Bioassay Lab at INI/Fiocruz 🧫, part of the city’s TB reference lab, contributing to research for the AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) and TB-Alliance as a scientist in diagnostics and clinical research 🧍‍🔬.

In 2021, I took the lead on the SMARTT study (Sequencing Mycobacteria and Algorithm-Determined Resistant Tuberculosis Treatment) 🧪, and now I coordinate a sub-study in South Africa focused on applying WGS for managing drug-resistant TB — it’s called PARR-TB, part of the broader GenPath Africa project 🌍 on pathogen genomics for public health.

## Research in Brazil

Back in Brazil 🇧🇷, I co-coordinate the TB Surveillance Network for Northern and Northeastern Brazil (REVIGET N/NE), in collaboration with the Evandro Chagas Institute (IEC), where I’m mainly involved in lab training for WGS workflows, data analysis, and making sure no mycobacterial genome goes unexamined 🔍🧬.

I’m also a proud member of the "Geoprocessing, Health and Environment" research group at IEC 🛰️ — because understanding where diseases happen is just as important as knowing why.
